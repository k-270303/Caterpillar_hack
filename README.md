## Vehicle Maintenance Optimization Project

Welcome to the **Caterpillar_hack** project! This repository focuses on optimizing vehicle maintenance through advanced analytics and intelligent planning.

## Features

### 1. Precautionary Alerts
Analyze vehicle data to predict component failures. This feature provides:
- **Insights** into parts prone to issues.
- **Best Practices** for preventive maintenance.
- **Visual Plot** comparing vehicle types and failure probabilities, helping identify sensitive parts and their potential causes.

### 2. Intelligent Work Planner
Optimize work schedules by considering:
- **Assets:** Number and type of vehicles.
- **Deadlines:** Critical, Hard, and Soft:
  - **Critical:** Ensures deadlines are met with advance orders for spare parts and equipment.
  - **Hard:** Allows a maximum 5-day extension, with recommendations for spare parts and equipment thereafter.
  - **Soft:** Advises extending deadlines if failure probability exceeds 50%, keeping downtime under 30%.
- **Weather Conditions:** Adjusts plans based on forecast data.
- **Work Type:** Tailors recommendations based on the nature of the work.

### 3. Daily Diagnosis
Provides daily workload recommendations based on:
- **Weather:** Current conditions.
- **Backlog:** Pending tasks.
- **Machine Name:** Specific asset details.
- **Initial KPIs:** Key performance indicators like fuel and temperature.
- **Assigned Tasks:** Tasks for the day.

The feature assesses the impact of workload recommendations on the overall plan and suggests additional machinery or order times if critical deadlines are at risk.
