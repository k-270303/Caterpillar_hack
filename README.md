Vehicle Maintenance Optimization Project
Welcome to the Caterpillar_hack project! This repository focuses on optimizing vehicle maintenance through advanced analytics and intelligent planning.

Features
1. Precautionary Alerts
Analyze vehicle data to predict component failures. This feature provides:

Insights into parts prone to issues.
Best Practices for preventive maintenance.
Visual Plot comparing vehicle types and failure probabilities, helping identify sensitive parts and their potential causes.
2. Intelligent Work Planner
Optimize work schedules by considering:

Assets: Number and type of vehicles.
Deadlines: Critical, Hard, and Soft.
Critical: Ensures deadlines are met with advance orders for spare parts and equipment.
Hard: Allows a maximum 5-day extension, with recommendations for spare parts and equipment thereafter.
Soft: Advises extending deadlines if failure probability exceeds 50%, keeping downtime under 30%.
Weather Conditions: Adjusts plans based on forecast data.
Work Type: Tailors recommendations based on the nature of the work.
3. Daily Diagnosis
Provides daily workload recommendations based on:

Weather: Current conditions.
Backlog: Pending tasks.
Machine Name: Specific asset details.
Initial KPIs: Key performance indicators like fuel and temperature.
Assigned Tasks: Tasks for the day.
The feature assesses the impact of workload recommendations on the overall plan and suggests additional machinery or order times if critical deadlines are at risk.
